<h2>What did this study involve?</h2>
<p>During the experiment you listened to a series of spoken statements and, on each trial, indicated whether a statement had appeared in a prior list (<em>“old”</em>) or was new. The aim was to understand how people remember information delivered by voice‑only search systems (e.g.&nbsp;Siri, Google&nbsp;Home) and how memory performance can be enhanced.</p>
<p>Unlike screen‑based searches—where results can be reviewed at your own pace—voice interfaces present information sequentially, making it harder to revisit earlier content. Building on the <em>serial‑position effect</em> (better recall of items at the beginning and end of a list), we examined how presentation order influences recall when answers are delivered aloud.</p>

<h2>Experimental conditions</h2>
<p>Participants were randomly assigned to conditions in which the spoken statements differed in linguistic complexity. By comparing recall across these conditions, we can determine whether the extra effort required to process more complex language helps or hinders memory.</p>
